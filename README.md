# My Data Science Journey

Hi!

My name is Mikiko Bazeley and this repo represents the culmination of my data science career learnings. 

My goal is to:
1. Map the necessary skills & sub-disciplines of data science
2. Illuminate the specific learnings & projects I engaged in
3. Track my progress


Code & projects are documented in the repo. 
Learnings & resources are located in the wiki.

Thanks!
